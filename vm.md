# Working with Virtual Machines in Azure and GCP

### Parts 1 and 2 Start and Stop a Virtual Machine and Monitor VM costs

#### Azure 

1. Create Virtual Machine

2. Monitor VM Costs
   - Due to the low cost(non existent) of running the vm rounded came to about 2 cents per hour, the billing section was unable to generate a report for the costs as observed below

#### GCP

### Part 3 Compare and Reflect

- Comparing the costs of both azure and GCP they were about the same. Azure being 2 cents and GCP being 3 cents per hour. These were both the cheapest configurations I could make. 
- Something to note for both was that they were both roughly ran for 5 minutes and due to the low cost per hour when the VM's were stopped neither had any cost associate to them.
- What I liked about GCP compared to azure was when setting up the VM it gave the cost per hour and cost per month. Azure only gave the cost per hour on the initial setup screen.
- Both were relativily easy to start up but again I would say GCP made things a little simpler by presenting all the info infront of you.
- I did like though that azure forces you to pick an instance name as oppose to just generating one like GCP, it forces you to have better readability.
- When it came to the billing reports again I would have to pick GCP over azure in this instance. When no cost is encurred azure fails to provide any sort of readable billing chart whereas GCP will still generate some kind of report even if it is all zeros.
- Both provide a robust amount of tools and starting and stopping the intances are as easy as pushing a button. These cloud platforms seem to have a easy to learn hard to master approach where anyone can just start and stop intances, but through learning you can optimize the usage of these intances and be able to provide the best availble options for when the time comes
